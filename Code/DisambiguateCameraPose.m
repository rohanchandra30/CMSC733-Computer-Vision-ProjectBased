function [C,R,X] = DisambiguateCameraPose(Cset, Rset, Xset)
%% Inputs:
% Cset and Rset: 4 configurations of camera centers and rotations
% Xset: 4 sets of triangulated points from four camera pose configurations
%% Outputs:
% C and R: the correct camera pose
%% Notes:
% The sign of the Z element in the camera coordinate system indicates the
% location of the 3D point with respect to the camera, i.e., a 3D point X
% is in front of a camera if (C;R) if r3'(X - C) > 0
% where r3 is the third row of R. Not all triangulated points satisfy this
% condition due to the presence of correspondence noise.
% The best camera configuration, (C,R,X) is the one that produces the max
% number of points satisfying the cheirality condition.
